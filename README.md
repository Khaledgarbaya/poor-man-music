# Poor Man's Music

Desktop music streaming application, built with [electron](http://electron.atom.io/).

It works erectly like Spotify: 

* Search for a song, an album or an artist 
* Select a song 
* Play
* ???
* Don't pay a single dime

The application will try to fetch a cover art for every song you start to play.
